CS_121_Fall_2014
================

Work used during the SI portion of the Fall 2014 CPSC 121 Class, Section 07-08, MoWe 5:30 - 6:20PM with Professor Anderson

__NOTE__: Most (if not all) updates to this repository are done between Friday evening and Saturday morning. If you've come 
to check for updates on the weekly work, best time to check it out is Saturday.

__Meeting Times__: 
- Wednesdays @ 4 - 5:00PM, ULC* (University Learning Center; Second Floor Pollak Library where the tutoring tables are)
- Fridays @ 12 - 1:00PM, CS 110B**

*To be specific, the SI will be located at the tables near the windows (farthest down, east side). You'll see me there a good ten minutes 
prior to the session.

**There is another SI session (specifically for CS 120) that goes on before ours. If you arrive early, just wait outside of the room 
until it's 12PM. Chances are I'll be outside waiting as well.

__Extra Information__:
- If you would like review on CS 120 topics, take a look at the References folder above. It covers most (if not all) 
possible review of the material you've worked on in CS 120 (that is, if you took that class at CSUF). The Weekly Work 
folder includes all the work done at each SI session each week throughout the Fall 2014 semester.
- If you need to contact me for whatever reason, my email is located at the bottom of this page
(and all other pages in this repository). I regularly attend lecture, I go to the lab for the first half hour or so, and 
of course you can talk to me during the SI session.


I look forward to working with you guys this semester!
