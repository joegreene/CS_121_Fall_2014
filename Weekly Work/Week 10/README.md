### Intro
This hosts the activities we worked on during the SI class on 10/29/14 and 10/31/14.

__NOTE__: If you guys feel like you do not have a clear picture on distinguishing "by reference" 
and "by value" parameters, check out [this link](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/373419/whats-the-difference-between-passing-by-reference-vs-passing-by-value) 
(Great analogy). For classes, [this](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/cpp_classes_objects.htm) may help (on top of the PowerPoint notes given).
