### Intro
Below are the notes from the Wednesday (9/24) SI session.

#### Notes
To prevent possible stress and clear people's minds, instead of having a 
worksheet or problems to work on, all we did was go over questions anyone 
who went to the SI session had. Majority of it consisted with switch cases, 
accessing arrays, and opening files with ifstream and ofstream objects.
