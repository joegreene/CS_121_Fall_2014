### Intro
Below are the notes from the Wednesday (10/08) SI session.

Topics discussed:
- By-value versus By-reference
- By-reference purpose

#### Notes
Majority of the session was spent talking about the differences between by-value and by-reference, and 
the purpose of calling a value by-reference.

For the first topic: Try running the program located on this page (the file "value_versus_reference_w7.cpp").

Second topic: I had this as a question in this week's worksheet. Look at the second section (concept questions), 
problem number two.
