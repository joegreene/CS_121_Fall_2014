### Intro
This hosts the activities we worked on during the SI class on 9/5/14.

### Topics
Below is the list of activities gone over during the SI session.

#### Activity 1
Because we only went over the first worksheet, refer back to Week 1 for a complete set of solutions
(I recently added code for the projects portion).

The second worksheet was passed out however, so I will include that in the resources folder for 
this week. I'll hold off on the solutions until next session passes.

I might make some revisions later on to the second worksheet however it is still there if you would 
like to see it.
