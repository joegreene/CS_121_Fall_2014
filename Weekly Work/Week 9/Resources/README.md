### Intro
This page hosts the solutions to the questions for this week's worksheet. I've added code for the (complete) 
FCylinder project. If you want to test it out in Visual Studio, make sure (when making the header file) to choose 
"Header File (.h)" or whichever the similar option is when adding a new file to the project solution.

### Worksheet
Below is the worksheet solutions for this week. As usual, click the worksheet .docx in the file listing above 
to download it.

__NOTE__: Make sure to read the headings on instructions on what you're supposed to do in the worksheet. I had 
people ask me what they're supposed to be doing with the code, and (on the top of the second page) I state 
exactly what you're supposed to write in.

#### Questions
For the syntax work portion
