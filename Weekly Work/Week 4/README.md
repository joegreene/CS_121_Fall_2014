### Intro
This hosts the activities we worked on during the SI class on 9/17/14 and 9/19/14.

### Topics
The worksheet for this week covers: 
- Nested for loops
- Text file input/output
- A little bit on two-dimensional arrays
- Counters (e.g. to increment through an array)
- Constant integers

#### Wednesday
Passed out the worksheet, however we did not go over the worksheet too much in detail.

Majority of the session was going over the following (from peers' questions):
- Psuedo-code practice
- Understanding switch cases more and the concept of cascading/falling-through switch cases
- Reading/outputting an array of lines from an input file

above (near the Resources folder area).

#### Friday
__REVISION__: I made an error in the original worksheet about the equilateral triangle print and the last section (2d array with File IO). 
Instead of "absolute value version" it should have been "two for loop" version. I was copying and pasting old work and I 
apologize for the mistake. Also I meant to say to output to console, however to make up for my error I will give both solutions.
I uploaded the revised worksheet.

Other than that: Most of the session was spent discussing questions about the topics listed below:
- File IO (namely, how to set up file IO and how it relates to `cout`/`cin`)
- Post versus Pre Increment/Decrement
- Array Access (using streams to initialize/output elements in an array)
