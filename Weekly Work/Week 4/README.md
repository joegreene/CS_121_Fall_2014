### Intro
This hosts the activities we worked on during the SI class on 9/17/14 and 9/19/14.

### Topics
The worksheet for this week covers: 
- Nested for loops
- Text file input/output
- A little bit on two-dimensional arrays
- Counters (e.g. to increment through an array)
- Constant integers

#### Wednesday
Passed out the worksheet, however we did not go over the worksheet too much in detail.

Majority of the session was going over the following (from peers' questions):
- Psuedo-code practice
- Understanding switch cases more and the concept of cascading/falling-through switch cases
- Reading/outputting an array of lines from an input file
