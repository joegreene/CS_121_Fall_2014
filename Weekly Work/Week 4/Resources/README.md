### Intro
As usual, the worksheet is the .docx file located near the top of this page. If you need it in another format (i.e. you do not 
have Microsoft Word or a suitable viewer for the file), send me an email or ask someone for a printout.

The worksheet might seem beefy, however that's because majority of it is explaining concepts.

### Questions
I didn't really label questions throughout the sheet, however there were sections required to plug in information.
There are many possible answers for most of the sections, however later on I will include what I believe are easy-to-read 
solutions.

#### Nested For Loops
TBD
