### Intro
Below are the notes from the Friday (10/17) SI session.

#### Notes
Notes are below.

Topics we covered:
- Structs Layout
- Structs vs Classes

##### Structs Layout
Almost identical to last session. Just went over how to declare and initialize a `struct`. Test out 
the `.cpp` on the main page if you're curious, or just do the work in the worksheet.

##### Structs vs Classes
Since we practically finished the structs worksheet, someone asked what classes were. Although we went into much 
detail during the session, it's a little too much to talk about here right now. The gist I can give (for now) is: 
If you ever want a chance at understanding how classes work, understand how structs work. They are extremely similar, 
and in fact have only one major difference.

If you would like to learn more on what classes are (and how they differ from structures), check out the following links:
- http://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/cpp_object_oriented.htm (classes and basic principles of OOP*)
- http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/classes/ (classes again)
- https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/lab/cplus/c++.rules/chap7.html (classes once more)
-  (struct/class difference)

*It won't help much if you don't have a background on the keypoints of object-oriented programming (OOP), so I suggest 
going to the top link first before the others.
