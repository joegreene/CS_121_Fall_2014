### Intro
This hosts the activities we worked on during the SI class on 10/15/14 and 10/17/14.

If you want to see a syntax example of declaring (and initializing) a struct, take a look 
at `struct_syntax_example.cpp` (in the file listing above), which is identical to the 
example given on page two of the worksheet.

Check out the resources folder for both solutions and some .cpp files to practice working 
with structures in both arrays and vectors (which are essentially full programs of question 4 
from the worksheet).
