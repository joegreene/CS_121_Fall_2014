### Intro
This page hosts the solutions to the questions for this week's worksheet. I've added code for the fourth problem 
in the file listing above (named `struct_array_example.cpp` and `struct_vector_example.cpp` respectively).

### Worksheet
Below is the worksheet solutions for this week. As usual, click `CS 121 
Worksheet - Week 8 - Structs.docx` in the file listing above to download 
the worksheet from this week.

__WARNING__: I forgot to include (in the fourth question) that you can choose whether or not 
to get the information from a file or console input. I added this edit to the uploaded worksheet.

__NOTE__: On top of the above, I made some minor edits in the worksheet to make 
some questions more clear. These edits are also already included in the uploaded worksheet.

#### Questions
TBD
