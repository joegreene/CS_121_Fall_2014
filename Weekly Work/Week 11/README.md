### Intro
This hosts the activities we worked on during the SI class on 11/5/14 and 11/7/14.

There was no worksheet introduced this week, so if anything check last week's directory 
for work on pointers.

### Topics
Below is a listing for the Wednesday and Friday notes from this week.

#### Wednesday
Topics discussed during the session:
- Dereferencing Pointers
- Converting Referenced Parameters to Pointer Parameters

Head to the Wednesday notes page above or click [here](WED_NOTES.md) to read 
what happened.

#### Friday
Due to the blackout (and to lessen confusion about classes being cancelled), there was no 
SI session on 11/7. Plans were to go over the pointers worksheet and answer any questions 
about the exam from Wednesday.

If you want to review the pointers worksheet, check out the solutions located in last week's folder. 
Otherwise you can always check the power point notes for help, read the notes located in this 
repository, or email me and Professor Anderson.
