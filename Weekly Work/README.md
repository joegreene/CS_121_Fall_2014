Weekly Work
===========

This is the main directory for all the activities that we have gone over . I fill 
out the "activity" parts after the SI session has occurred, primarily because I 
won't know what we actually covered until the session is finished.

For some weeks I may choose to upload practice projects, that is, if we either 
worked on some during the SI session or I felt generous. Either way, they aren't 
mandatory in any way and only serve to help hone your C++ programming skills.

Remember: If you have any ideas or questions that you would like to work on during the SI 
sessions, please let me know either via email, during the class time, or during the SI 
session. If I'm not told anything I'll just make worksheets/mini-projects based mainly 
off of lecture or what I consider something that needs to be practiced.
