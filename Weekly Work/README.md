Weekly Work
===========

This is the main directory for all the activities that we have gone over 

For some weeks I may choose to upload practice projects, that is, if we either 
worked on some during the SI session or I felt generous. Either way, they aren't 
mandatory in any way and only serve to help hone your C++ programming skills.
