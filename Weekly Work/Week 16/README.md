### Intro
This hosts the activities we worked on during the SI class on 12/10/14 and 12/12/14.

As a pro-tip:

If you're ever lost with any of the recursion (or iteration), the best thing you can do for yourself is to 
__trace the program__. This helps immensely when trying to understand what's going on each step, and will 
significantly help you out in 131 and later programming.

Another thing: It's been great working with you guys this semester, and good luck on finals!
