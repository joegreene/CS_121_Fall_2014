### Intro
This hosts the activities we worked on during the SI class on 8/29/14. If there are any errors, please let me know (I'm only human).

### Topics

#### Activity 1
The worksheet and solutions we worked on during the session can be found in the Resources folder on this page (at top).

Of course, I suggest you first try to do as much of the worksheet as you can before looking at the solutions. If any of the 
words on there do not make sense, head over to the references folder I have made in this GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/joegreene/CS_121_Fall_2014/tree/master/References).

### Extra Notes
If you'd like, you can head over to my previous semester's repository [here](https://github.com/joegreene/Spring-2014-CS-Lab--SI-). 
Keep in mind that last semester was my first time working with GitHub, so the content 
listed in there is either messy or incomplete.

Alternatively, the page is accessible via the [root directory](https://github.com/joegreene).
