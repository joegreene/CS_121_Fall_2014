### Extra Notes
If you'd like, you can head over to my previous semester's repository [here](https://github.com/joegreene/Spring-2014-CS-Lab--SI-). 
Keep in mind that last semester was my first time working with GitHub, so the content 
listed in there is either messy or incomplete.

Alternatively, the page is accessible via the [root directory](https://github.com/joegreene).
