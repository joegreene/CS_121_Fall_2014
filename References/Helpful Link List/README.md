### Intro
Below is a list of websites I've either found useful or have been recommended to me while taking the CPSC 121 class (and CPSC 131 class).

If you know of any other websites that may benefit the class, feel free to let me know so I may add them to this list. 

#### Documentation Help, Techniques, and Style
Although there are plenty of links to help with this: Best thing to do with code is to have one style and stay consistent with it. Other than that, the following links might help:
- http://www.edparrish.net/common/cppdoc.html - A site I recently found that proved informative
- http://www.cprogramming.com/tutorial/style.html - good advice 
- http://www.cprogramming.com/how_to_learn_to_program.html - good advice for when starting out (especially the first bold text)

Normally it's a good idea to pick a few ideas from other programmers, and build your own technique from there. Stick with the most commonly used programming styles and develop 
a consistent style from there. 

I have to include this: Always use two to four spaces for indentation instead of tabs! Tabs only serve to make your code a nightmare (that is, if you look at it in other text document viewers).

#### Compilers and IDEs
- http://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-express-vs.aspx - Visual Studio (the main IDE used in the class; windows-only); I use this primarily
as it's what is used during the CS 301 test (and all professors expect you to work with this IDE for projects in the class).
  - NOTE: Express versions are just as good as professional and ultimate. If you don't have a DreamSpark account with the school or a means 
of easily getting the professional version, just stick with an express version. If asked, go for the visual studio express C++ version.
  - NOTE 2: I don't know about the school computers, but if you use this at home and wish to change the color scheme check 
this out: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh923906.aspx . Visual Studio 2012/2013's theme jump from 2010 makes it look disgusting.
- http://ideone.com/ - Online compiler (great for testing small code on-the-go). I use this to test most of the activity code we work with.
- http://www.codeblocks.org/downloads - I've only used this for a bit, and it's a nice and lightweight IDE.
- http://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse373/99au/unix/g++.html - g++ compiler (console based, NOT an IDE)
  - Great compiler although it takes some time to get used to, plus annoying to use unless you have a nice terminal (i.e. not Microsoft's cmd.exe)
  - Another link to look at for g++ is this: http://www.cprogramming.com/g++.html
- https://developer.apple.com/xcode/ - C++ IDE for Mac OS X (NOTE: I have no experience with this whatsoever, so make buddies with someone that 
has used this if you plan to program on an Apple computer)

#### General FAQ
- http://stackoverflow.com/ - website with plenty of helpful questions/answers
- http://www.cplusplus.com/forum/ - I don't use this as much as stackoverflow, but it helped a lot when I first started programming

#### Text Document Viewers
If you're on a Windows-based system: Ditch notepad and wordpad. They'll only make your life worse, especially if you're editing code.

Popular text viewers:
- http://notepad-plus-plus.org/ - HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! I use this for typing all my code when I'm outside Visual Studio or any IDE. Great all-purpose text editor for Windows-based systems.
- http://www.vim.org/download.php - Another recommended text editor. It's console-based, so it might take time getting used to, but from what I heard it pays off in the long run. Supports many operating systems.
- http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/ - Rivals Vim. I'm not sure if I recommend this one because it's more time-demanding than Vim, but still worth a shot (especially if you're working on a linux distro).
- http://macromates.com/ - I've never used this myself, but I heard it's a great text editor for Mac OS X

Also as a side note: When I say Emacs rivals Vim, [I mean it](#http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1430164/differences-between-emacs-and-vim).

#### Reference Websites:
- http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/ - I use this a lot when rummaging around the STL (standard library)
- http://en.cppreference.com/w/ - Another website I use for reference
- http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/60k1461a.aspx - I don't use this as much as the others, but helps nonetheless (WARNING: Very technical)

#### Tutorial Websites
- http://www.cprogramming.com/tutorial/c++-tutorial.html - I don't use this as much as the others, but still helps
- http://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/ - Might be a bit technical at some parts, but helpful
- http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/ - Also a bit technical, but it helps nonetheless

#### Neat Websites for Fun (and CPSC 131 Prep)
- http://opendatastructures.org/ - Great reference for the data structures class (highly recommend taking a look, even if not taking the course)
- http://www.sorting-algorithms.com/ - Neat site for looking at how 
- http://panthema.net/2013/sound-of-sorting/ - Fun program to mess around with when bored. Helps understand efficiency in sorting algorithms. Remember: Bogo-sort is the best kind of sort.
  - NOTE: The program is standalone, so no need to worry about installing it or anything. Download the win32 binary for windows computers, and linux binary for linux-based computers.
  - NOTE 2: If you don't wish to download it (you're missing out if you don't), you can see a demo of it on youtube here (WARNING: Might be loud): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPRA0W1kECg
