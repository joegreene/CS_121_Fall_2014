#### Text File IO Practice
For the text_file_io_practice code, I put everything within a zip file (should be around the top of this page).
Click the zip file and it should let you download it to your desktop or wherever you choose. 

After extracting its contents, throw everything where your .vcxproj files are. If you're unsure of where that is, 
I've included an image in the zip file to give an idea on where that would be on a Windows 7 computer. It should be 
the same for any windows-based computer using some Visual Studio variant.

If you need help with opening and extracting zip files, my best advice is to use Google's search engine or 
whatever your favorite search engine is.
