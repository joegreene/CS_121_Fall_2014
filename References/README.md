This area covers most (if not all) possible review of the material you've worked on in CS 120 (that is, 
if you took that class at CSUF). It also covers various tips that you may want to heed if you're curious about 
typing style and program constructs.

If you would like to view it: My previous semester's SI GitHub page is located [here](https://github.com/joegreene/Spring-2014-CS-Lab--SI-). 
It's a bit messy and incomplete at some parts, but it goes into a lot of detail on most topics discussed in 120.
